#**Embedded Spatial Measurement System | C & Python**

This project involves the development of an **Embedded Spatial Measurement System** using a combination of **C programming** for microcontroller hardware and **Python** for data processing. The system collects distance measurements of the surrounding area to map an indoor environment.

##**Key Features**

- **Hardware:** The system utilizes embedded systems with microcontroller hardware, a stepper motor and a time-of-flight sensor as the foundation for capturing distance measurements.

- **C Programming:** C programming is employed for the microcontroller firmware, enabling efficient control and data collection from the spatial measurement sensor.

- **Communication Protocols:** Implementation of communication protocols such as **UART** and **I2C** facilitates seamless interaction between the microcontroller and other components of the system.

- **Python Integration:** Python is used for data processing and visualization. The obtained distance measurements are processed in Python, and the system outputs the data into an image format for comprehensive mapping of the indoor environment.

##**Getting Started**

1. **Microcontroller Setup:**
   Set up the microcontroller hardware with the stepper motor and time-of-flight sensor and upload the provided firmware code to begin capturing distance measurements.
