Embedded Spatial Measurement System | C & Python
This project involves the development of an Embedded Spatial Measurement System using a combination of C programming for microcontroller hardware and Python for data processing. The system collects distance measurements of the surrounding area to map an indoor environment.

Key Features
Microcontroller Hardware: The system utilizes embedded systems with microcontroller hardware as the foundation for capturing distance measurements.

C Programming: C programming is employed for the microcontroller firmware, enabling efficient control and data collection from the spatial measurement sensors.

Communication Protocols: Implementation of communication protocols such as UART and I2C facilitates seamless interaction between the microcontroller and other components of the system.

Python Integration: Python is used for data processing and visualization. The obtained distance measurements are processed in Python, and the system outputs the data into an image format for comprehensive mapping of the indoor environment.
